## Project Overview
This project applies the knowledge acquired during the SQL module of the Data & Analytics V3 course. 
It focuses on a set of 64 SQL queries based on a database provided specifically for this project.

## Dataset and Methodology Applied
Considering the database shared for the project, **DBeaver** was used as the database management tool to execute the 64 SQL queries.  
The script **Data Project Logica Consultas SQL** contains each query along with its corresponding solution. 
In some cases, additional comments are included to clarify the logic applied and/or to indicate doubts regarding the query.

**Project Files:**
- **BBDD_Proyecto** – Database provided for the project;  
- **Data Project Logica Consultas SQL** – SQL script; 
- **BBDD Proyecto SQL_ERD** – Database ERD;  

## Conclusions
At first, the project required dedicated time to become familiar with the provided database.  
The ERD was essential for understanding table relationships and the application of JOINs, as it shows how primary and foreign keys are linked.  
Overall, the solutions to the queries were based on the knowledge acquired during the module; however, access to additional resources was necessary to further understand some concepts.
